# Weather-API-Challenge

## Description

My motivation for making this project was to learn how to use api's in order to utilize data in an application. I built this project because the weather api is a common and useful api with a lot of data that can be applied to an app in many different ways. This application can be used by anyone to check the current weather as well as the weather for the next five days in one central location at the click of a button while storing your recent searches. I learned a lot about apis regarding fetching the url and making the data readable, then applying it to an app in an interactive way.
